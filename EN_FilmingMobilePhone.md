### Plan Your Shots
Mobile phones have limited storage capacity. Be selective in what you
record. Monitor the amount of space you have available on your phone.

### Capture Detail and Perspective
Mobile phones have a wide-angle lens with limited zoom capabilities.
Physically move closer to record details and move back to show a wider
perspective of events.

### Keep Your Shots Steady
Don’t wave your phone around trying to film everything at once. Choose
your shot and hold it steady for at least 10 seconds. Avoid zooming. Use
both hands and keep your elbows against your body for added support and
stability.

### Hold Your Phone Horizontally
Hold your phone horizontally in order to capture a wider angle and so
your image looks better when played on a TV or computer monitor.

### Get in Close for Good Sound
Move closer to your interviewee so the microphone can pick up better
audio. Be aware of loud noises that could drown out interviews.

### Be Aware of Lighting
Mobile phones do not record well in low light. Record interviews in a
well-lit location. For the best images always keep the sun to your back.

### Personal Safety
Phone calls and the phone’s location can be traced through the mobile
network provider. If there are security risks, disable the GPS
application and keep the phone turned off with its battery removed when
not in use.

### Protect Your Friends and Contacts
If your phone is seized, names of contacts, call logs, text messages,
photographs, videos and audio files can be accessed. If there is a risk
of having your phone confiscated, delete or encrypt all sensitive data.

### Protect Your Media
Assess the best way to keep your media card safe from those who may not
want your images shared publicly. Consider swapping out the used card
with a blank card, hiding the used one or giving it to a friend to store
safely. If you can safely connect to the internet, consider immediately
uploading media files to a site like YouTube or Twitter, or share them
with a trusted friend via email or text.
